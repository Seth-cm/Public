# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hey, I’m a Systems Engineer who works across infrastructure, automation, and virtualization. This repo reflects my hands-on work and experiments in environments powered by:

- 🖥️ vCenter & VMware
- ⚡ PowerShell automation
- 📦 Containers with Podman & Docker
- 🧰 Linux systems engineering and orchestration

## 🔧 What You'll Find Here

- Infrastructure scripts and templates I use in production
- PowerShell tools for managing vSphere, Windows, and more
- Container setups for services like Plex, Radarr, and Prowlarr
- Notes, configs, and automation meant for real-world ops

## 💡 Why This Exists

I use GitHub to track my own tooling, build reusable infrastructure pieces, and share things that might save another engineer a headache or three.
